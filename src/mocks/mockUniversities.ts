    corporate: `“Mind and Hand” is the thought-provoking motto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, known also as MIT. 
This motto encapsulates this famous institution’s mission to advance knowledge in science, technology, and areas 
of scholarship that can help make the world a better place. At its founding in 1861, MIT was initially a small 
community of problem-solvers and science lovers eager to bring their knowledge to bear on the world. Today, MIT 
has evolved into an educational behemoth, with some 1,000 faculty members and more than 11,000 undergraduate 
and graduate students.`,
